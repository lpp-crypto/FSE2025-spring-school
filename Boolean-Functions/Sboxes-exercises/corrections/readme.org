#+TITLE: Correction

* Q1
** Statement
Print the lookup table of the S-box of the =PRESENT= block cipher. Print the length (in the Python sense) of this object. Anything strange?
** Answer
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle scripts/Q1.py
from sage.crypto.sboxes import sboxes

s = sboxes["PRESENT"]
print(len(s))
print(len(list(s)))
      
#+END_SRC

Be careful, the SAGE =SBox= implements the =__len__= method in a counter-intuitive way: it returns the bit-length of the input, not the number of elements in the LUT!

* Q2
** Statement
Print the lookup tables of all the S-boxes of the =SERPENT= block cipher.
